DRY - Do not repeat yourself
SEPARATION OF CONCERNS - 

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
- use to make web pages responsive -

HTML is used to structure the web page, CSS takes the responsibility of the design.

selector {
    property : value;
}

// single selector
p{
    color: blue;
}

// multiple-selectors
p, h1{
    color: blue;
}

Ways to add CSS to the markup?
1. inline => CSS is added to the elements directly using the style attribute.
2. internal => CSS is kept inside the style tag inside the HTML file.
3. external =>CSS is kept in an external sheet, and linked with the HTML file using the link tag.

Which has the highest precedence?
INLINE 
Internal vs external => neither of them takes the priority. Which ever code has been written at the last, will take the priority.

id vs class
id - identifier - unique
class - can be applied to multiple elements

Selectors in CSS
a. single element selector e.g. p
b. grouping selector e.g. p, h1
c. id selector 
d. class selector

BLOCK element => takes the whole available space. The next element starts at the new line.

INLINE element => only takes the necessary space

DEVELOPER TOOLS:
elements = you can find your HTML code, including the live server injected code.
user-defined style sheet => the default values provided by the browser.
Sources => shows all the files that you have written for the project.
how to check whether an element is a block or an inline

FONTS
web safe fonts = the common fonts that come as pre-installed with most of the OS.
web fonts = downloaded from the internet.

there are two ways:
1. link = they will go in the HTML file.
2. @import = they will go in the CSS file.

px = pixel = 1/96th of an inch
1 inch = 2.5 cm

Assigning Colors:
1. By Name - red, green, etc.
2. by rgb
3. by hexadecimal value = #1f3ff3
1f = red; 3f = green; f3 = blue;
4. by HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)
Hue = degree of the color field from 0 to 260.
0 is red; 120 is green; 240 is blue;
Saturation = %age value
Lightness - %age value, where 0 black, 50% 100% white
hsla
a = alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (not transparent)


border-radius = makes the border corners curvy.

background-size
Cover = the browser will manage the background image by itself. However, it may cut off the image.
Contain = The image will not be distorted, will not be cut off, but it may not be able to fill the whole background. 

----
The actual width of an element contains padding + border

lets say you have set a width of 100px

100px + 50px + 10px = 160px

box-sizing - content-box - by default value
the height/width you have specified is being given to the content and not the container. the content will be fixed and the height/width that you will set, will be extra.

border-box - the size of the content will adjust itself. the border/padding will be included in the width/height that you have set.
