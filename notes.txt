DRY - Do not repeat yourself
SEPARATION OF CONCERNS - 

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
- use to make web pages responsive -

HTML is used to structure the web page, CSS takes the responsibility of the design.

selector {
    property : value;
}

// single selector
p{
    color: blue;
}

// multiple-selectors
p, h1{
    color: blue;
}

Ways to add CSS to the markup?
1. inline => CSS is added to the elements directly using the style attribute.
2. internal => CSS is kept inside the style tag inside the HTML file.
3. external =>CSS is kept in an external sheet, and linked with the HTML file using the link tag.

Which has the highest precedence?
INLINE 
Internal vs external => neither of them takes the priority. Which ever code has been written at the last, will take the priority.

id vs class
id - identifier - unique
class - can be applied to multiple elements

Selectors in CSS
a. single element selector e.g. p
b. grouping selector e.g. p, h1
c. id selector 
d. class selector

BLOCK element => takes the whole available space. The next element starts at the new line.

INLINE element => only takes the necessary space

DEVELOPER TOOLS:
elements = you can find your HTML code, including the live server injected code.
user-defined style sheet => the default values provided by the browser.
Sources => shows all the files that you have written for the project.

FONTS
web safe fonts = the common fonts that come as pre-installed with most of the OS.
web fonts = downloaded from the internet.

there are two ways:
1. link = they will go in the HTML file.
2. @import = they will go in the CSS file.
